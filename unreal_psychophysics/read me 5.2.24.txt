1.place the unreal_psychophysics folder on your desktop

2.Go to the "Studies" folder and inside your study create a subject folder and name it like this: sub_001
  Put the subject's Answers.csv in the new subject folder.

3.Click on "unreal_psychophysics.Rproj" - RStudio opens

4. Go back to the folder and click on "run_unreal_psy.R"

5.In RStudio click on "Source"

5.Then type in the terminal: run_unreal_psy()
	EXAMPLE:
	'Subject number:' 023
	'Study folder name:' wonderland
	'Fitting attempt number:' 1

5. Results will appear inside the subject folder
a. a results folder: 'results_sub_xxx'
b. 2 staircase figures
c. curve fit figure
d. thresholds csv
e. the original answers file saved as 'Attempt_#_Answers...'
f. a cleaned data file for later analyses called 'staircase_data_sub_xxx...'
g. In another folder: the input csv for unreal test and train ('trials_unreal_xxx.csv')
	with the thresholds already loaded

Repeat_jnd

1. If you need to repeat a staircase, you will see the subtitle is RED in the matlab fit figure
This means there is already a repeat file in the repeat folder at:
"Experiment\\UnrealData\\Plans\\repeat_JND"

2. Run the repeat experiment and place the new Answers.csv in the subject folder in unreal_psychophysics

3. Run repeat_jnd.R

4. New results will appear in a separate results folder named by the attempt number.
   Repeated conditions will have purple plot titles in the staircase figures so you will be able to know the condition was repeated from the graph.
